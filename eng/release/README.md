# Release process

[package-consumers.yml](../../.github/workflows/package-consumers.yml) owns packing, consumer qualification, and tag publication.

1. The package job runs `tooling pack -Configuration Release` in the canonical Linux amd64 container and uploads the packed three-package graph.
2. Linux consumer qualification downloads those artifacts and runs `package-consumers` with the supplied feed, including the real verifier.
3. Tags additionally run exact-SHA security and portable consumers on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
4. A `v*` tag must exactly match `SharpProofPackageVersion` in [SharpProof.Release.props](../../SharpProof.Release.props).
5. Publication depends on all required tag jobs and runs only in the canonical repository. It downloads the package artifacts and pushes with duplicate skipping.

`v1.0.0-preview.1` selects the private-preview environment/feed. Other matching release tags select nuget.org and NuGet OIDC login. Feed credentials stay in the configured secret/environment mechanism.

Branch package checks do not run tag-only portable/security publication dependencies and do not publish. Do not report branch success as release qualification or public feed availability.

[third-party-components.json](third-party-components.json) records package components summarized in [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt](../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt). [Native SMT packaging](../../docs/native-smt-packaging.md) describes layout and pinned payload checks.
